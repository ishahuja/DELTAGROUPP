         <h1>DELTA</h1>
         <p> Delta is a puzzle-platformer horror adventure game that is intended to be a form of 
             expression which has no true conclusion, but a prompt termination at the end revealing 
             the real truth.  <br> <br> <br> The initial environment is set to a dystopian world. 
             When the player touches certain objects, the world around him glitches into a different environment - a peaceful nature setting. 
             The player will face enemies and obstacles during their journey. The abrupt ending of the game will reveal that the world in which the character exists is a simulation, a matrix, with no further explanation, leaving a lot of questions unanswered. 
             It is our goal to grant the Player the ability to have their own interpretation of the game , there is no right or wrong one. This will open the world of game theories created by Players, attracting even more interest to the game itself.
            <br> <br> <br> "Believe nothing you see, and only half that you hear" <br> <br> <br> <br> and underprepared, the Player must scavenge resources, improvise solutions and use their wits not just to succeed in your mission but to simply stay alive.
